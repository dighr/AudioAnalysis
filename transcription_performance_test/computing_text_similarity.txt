The common way of comparing similarity between two strings is to transform the texts into tf-idf vectors,
then the compute cosine similarity between both of the strings.
See https://towardsdatascience.com/overview-of-text-similarity-metrics-3397c4601f50
Tf-idf (and similar text transformations) are implemented in the Python packages Gensim and scikit-learn.
In our fuction, sickit-learn was used.

These function returns a score between 0 - 1.
1 means that the generated transcription is 100% matching the original transcription
0 means that the generated transcription is not matching the original transcription at all

This score is computed for all pairs for original and generated transcriptions and the average of these is
taken.

The common way of comparing similarity is to transform the texts into tf-idf vectors, then the cosine similarity between both of the strings. See https://towardsdatascience.com/overview-of-text-similarity-metrics-3397c4601f50

Tf-idf (and similar text transformations) are implemented in the Python packages Gensim and scikit-learn. In our fuction, sickit-learn was used.

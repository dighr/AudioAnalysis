## Content
This folder contains the transcription results of an arabic dataset obtained from Azure and google's transcription API

## Dataset 
This dataset is obtained from the University of oxford text archive
"Arabic Speech corpus" by Nawar Halabi
http://ota.ox.ac.uk/desc/2561

## Transcription Procedure
Within the test.py script under the parent folder of this directory, there is a method named
The method takes in different parameters as described below to identify which vendor ((Google, Azure, watson) 
or the open source english transcription modal deepseech ) and which language to use.
Once this is done, an API call is made to the respective vendor to transcribe the audio using the specified language modal

### transcribe_audios(files_path, format, modal_code, type)
#### inputs
This method takes in a the following parameters:
   - files_path: the path where the audios files are located
   - format: "mp3" or "wav"
   - modal_code: any of the arabic modals supported by google, azure. The modal code for google can be obtained from 
    the following URL  https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/docs/languages
   - type: can be either "azure", "google", "watson", "deepspeech"
            Since "watson" and "deepspeech", don't support Arabic yet, "azure" and "google" is able to use
   
#### outputs
A csv file that contains the transcription results associated with each file is generated
This method saves the results generated by the specified modals and vendor (type) into a csv file. 
The csv file will be created after 10 transcriptions. Everytime 10 audios are transcribed, the csv file will be 
automatically saved

#### Prerequisite
- API keys for each vendor (Google, Azure, Watson) has to be correctly configured within the engine.py file of the transcription analysis folder
- An empty folder named "audio_files" have to be added to this folder. In case the format of the audio is not '.wav', 
  this folder will be used as a temporary location to automatically convert the audio files into wav
- For deepspeech, the open source modal (around 4 GB) should be downloaded and added into the parent directory of the project
